          The common names "sunflower" and "common sunflower" typically refer to
          the popular annual species Helianthus annuus, whose round flower heads
          in combination with the ligules look like the sun.

          Tall sunflowers are generally yellow and durable. Most of these
          sunflowers reach 12 to 16 feet tall and even higher in special
          circumstances. Types of tall sunflowers include Skyscraper, Sunforest
          Mix and Russian Mammoth. Most of these sunflowers are enjoyed by birds
          for their height and abundance of seeds. This makes tall sunflowers
          attractive for people who enjoy bird watching.

          In a study by ScienceMag, scientists reveal sunflowers have circadian
          rhythms, which promote this behavior. A young sunflower’s face follows
          the sun from sunrise to sunset every day and repeats the cycle until
          maturity.

          The head of the sunflower is a combination of a thousand tiny flowers.
          In fact, each petal on the circumference of a sunflower is a flower
          itself. These long, colorful petals are known as “ray florets.”
